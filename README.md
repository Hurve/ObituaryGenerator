This plugin integrates Google Gemini and the Discord API to AI generate obituaries whenever a player dies and send them in chat and in a Discord channel. The AI is prompted to create a customized obituary using the player name, means of death, and items in the player's inventory, ensuring a personal (and oftentimes funny) obituary.

The plugin requires a Gemini API Key to function, which can be easily created on Google's AI Developer Website free of charge. Discord integration is optional, and if you want to incorporate a bot, simply follow this tutorial. All keys and the ID of the channel that you want to send the messages in are stored in the config.yml file.

This plugin is in very early development and may have bugs, so reach out if there are any problems with it!
